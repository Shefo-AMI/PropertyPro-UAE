## Your questions, answered

[General](https://www.doorloop.com/#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-0) [Product](https://www.doorloop.com/#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-1) [Support](https://www.doorloop.com/#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-2)

### What is rental property management software?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)

Rental property management software is an all-in-one platform that helps landlords, property managers, and real estate investors manage their rentals online.

Instead of juggling spreadsheets or multiple tools, a property management system centralizes everything in one place, from tenant screening, lease management, rent collection, and property accounting to maintenance tracking, reporting, and owner/tenant portals.

A property management software is a system that helps landlords and property owners save time, reduce errors, improve tenant satisfaction, and scale their portfolios more efficiently.

‍

### What is DoorLoop, and who is it for?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)

DoorLoop is an all-in-one, cloud-based property management software designed for landlords, property managers, and real estate investors.

It helps you handle every aspect of managing rentals in one place — from online rent collection, tenant screening, lease management, and maintenance requests to full property accounting, owner and tenant portals, reporting, and integrations with tools like QuickBooks.

‍

Trusted by [thousands of real estate professionals](https://www.doorloop.com/awards) worldwide, DoorLoop makes it easy to save time, streamline operations, and scale your portfolio without stress.

Learn more about our [features](https://www.doorloop.com/features) or see [pricing](https://www.doorloop.com/pricing).

### How much does property management software cost?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)

Property management software typically costs anywhere from $1 to $10+ per unit per month, depending on the features, portfolio size, and level of support included.

Some platforms offer flat monthly fees, while others charge per unit, with prices increasing as you add advanced tools like accounting, maintenance tracking, or integrations.

**DoorLoop offers flexible pricing starting at $69/month**, with plans based on the number of units you manage and the features you need. This makes it easy for landlords and property managers to scale without overpaying.

Compare plans on our [pricing page](https://www.doorloop.com/pricing) to find the best fit for your portfolio.

‍

### How many programs will DoorLoop replace?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)

The beauty of DoorLoop is it removes the need and cost for all your other programs.

Here are some of the things you can do with _just_ DoorLoop:

1. Replace QuickBooks with full property accounting and reporting
2. Use our tools instead of Word for rental applications and leases
3. Use eSignatures over printing, scanning, and faxing
4. Eliminate endless phone calls with a tenant portal
5. Automate background checks instead of manually screening tenants
6. Collect rent online, reducing admin work
7. Track maintenance requests and vendors
8. Set automated reminders

With DoorLoop, you can achieve more with less hassle.

### Is there free property management software available?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)

Yes, there are free property management software options on the market, but they usually come with trade-offs.

Free plans often limit the number of units you can manage and may exclude essential features like full accounting, online rent payments, maintenance tracking, reporting, or tenant/owner portals. Many also include ads, hidden fees, or minimal support.

**DoorLoop isn’t free, but it’s affordable and designed to save property managers far more than it costs**
